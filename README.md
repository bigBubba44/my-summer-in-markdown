# my-summer-in-markdown

## Intro!
My name is Logan Donan, and I am in 10th grade. I enjoy spending my time with others, indulging in hobbies I enjoy, and listening to music. I am often times a very open person and will welcome those who will welcome me. 

## Projects!!!
Over summer, I worked on a multitude of things. I tried working on bringing up my self motivation, worked on creating a comfortable room environment, and worked on other projects to keep me entertained. Many nights were spent contemplating and trying to see what I could do to improve my character. I also worked on my room, creating a soothing environment for myself and my pets. I worked on a lego car this summer, using spare bricks and motors I learned about steering, powertrains, and how such devices work.

## Goals!
This summer I set out on making goals and building a path towards success in the future. I would like to work at a mechanics college, or try and apply at a company known as Lanzante. This is my dream job, and although it may be a long time away and far away, I believe I can succeed in the future.

## Favorite Summer Food!
Over the summer, in my stay in yosemite, I tried a dish from a cafe. This dish was Macarona and cheese with bbq brisket. It was delicious.

## Summer Activites! 
In summer, I mainly spent my time inside, and on occasion outide. I watched F1 when I was inside, and spent my time enjoying my rc cars when I was outside. It was fun.

## Fun Fact! 
I have amassed such a large amount of Lego that I have run out of space. I have a lego collection worth $2000+
